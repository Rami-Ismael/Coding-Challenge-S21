I was hoping to use deep learning. Because, I interested in deep learning.
Instead, I have to other method to visualize the data. First, I must find a python
library to deal with new data file.  That will be the bIo.SeqIO. I have to create a new python
environment for the informatics . I installed BioPython.
I don't know what is genomic feature I google it. 
Check the version of the module.

Read chapter 17 biopython tutorial 
I need to install  rerpotlab for the tutorial
The All attribute method help me define what the property of the what is feature in a genome

Chapter 17

First create a seq object that will have a Genome.gb file in

I will create a diagram that is track to see what it look like

All the feature in the SeqObject will SeqRecord object in the class
    I have to iterate through all the SeqRecord that are gene
        add each feature to the diagram
        iterate  through two different color
write the diagram  in circular form  to a
