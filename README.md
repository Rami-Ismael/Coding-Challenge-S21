I was hoping to use deep learning. Because, I interested in deep learning.
Instead, I have to other method to visualize the data. First, I must find a python
library to deal with new data file.  That will be the bIo.SeqIO. I have to create a new python
environment for the informatics . I installed BioPython.
I don't know what is genomic feature I google it. 
Check the version of the module.

Read chapter 17 biopython tutorial 
I need to install  rerpotlab for the tutorial
The All attribute method help me define what the property of the what is feature in a genome

Chapter 17

First create a seq object that will have a Genome.gb file in

I will create a diagram that is track to see what it looks like

All the feature in the SeqObject will SeqRecord object in the class
1.I have to iterate through all the SeqRecord that are gene
2.add each feature to the diagram
3.iterate  through two different color
4.write the diagram  in circular form 

The Creator of the python library is  Peter J. A. Cock, Tiago Antao, Jeffrey T. Chang, Brad A. Chapman, Cymon J. Cox, Andrew Dalke, Iddo Friedberg, Thomas Hamelryck, Frank Kauff, Bartek Wilczynski, Michiel J. L. de Hoon
