I was hoping to use deep learning. Because, I intersted in deep learning.
Instead, I have to other method to visualize the data. First, I must find a python
libary to deal with new data file.  The will be the bIo.SeqIO. I have to crate a new python
enviorment for the bioinformatics . I isntalled BioPython.
I don't know what is genomic feature I google it. 
Check the version of the module.

Read chapter 17 biopython tutuorial
I need to isntall  rerpotlab for the tutorial
The Allattribute method help me define what the property of the what is feature in a genome

Chapter 17

First create a seq object that will have a Genome.gb file in

I will create a diagram that is track to see what it look like

All the feature in the SeqObject will SeqRecord object in the class
    I have to iterate through all the SeqREcord that are gene
        add each feature to the diagram
        itreatate through two different color
write the digram in circular form  to a
